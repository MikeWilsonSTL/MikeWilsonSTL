### Hey, I'm Mike 👨‍💻
I’m a software developer based in St. Louis, MO.
I'm working towards a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from WGU. 
When I'm not studying for that, I'm working on Raspberry Pi projects, homelab projects, and learning more about networking as well as secure coding practices.
