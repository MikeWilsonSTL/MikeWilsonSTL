Hey, I'm Mike 👨‍💻

I’m a Linux-focused sysadmin and datacenter technician .
I'm working towards a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from WGU. 
When I'm not studying for that, I'm either working in data centers across the country or I'm stubbornly working to get enterprise performance out of my homelab. (I *will* get this high-availability Proxmox cluster working the way I want it to 😤)
